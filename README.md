# POV-Display

POV: an acronym for the persistence of vision, is a kind of optical illusion in which a visual image seems to persist even when the light from it ceases to enter our eyes.

This is the code of an arduino based persistence of vision (POV) display that I made in 2017.

It can display any kind of text.
